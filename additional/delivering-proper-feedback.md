# Delivering proper feedback

This document is meant to explain clear boundaries of what is a proper feedback, and what isn't.

It explains as well what is a good feedback and how to structure it with the DESC method.

## What feedback is not

Feedback is never taking its roots outside of facts:
* Expressing statements based on interpersonal feelings is not proper feedback
* Expressing prejudice is not proper feedback
* Judging someone is not proper feedback

Feedback is never meant to harm somebody, but instead to help her/him grow:
* [Nagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagging) is not proper feedback
* [Bullying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying) is not proper feedback
* [Doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) is not proper feedback

Feedback is useless if incomplete:
* Don't assume the person receiving the feedback knows everything about the topic at hand. Provide all needed informations or resources that back your feedback
* Don't provide criticism without guidance toward a better solution

Unsolicited feedback is not good feedback:
* Delivering unsolicited feedback is not educating, it's forcing your opinion on somebody not asking for it
* Doing it once is rude and mean
* Doing it repeatedly is just plain harassment

Delivering feedback is not a way to put you under the spotlights.

## What is proper feedback

TL;DR: **Polite, timely, factual and helpful**

All examples in this section will take the fictional situation of you trying to give feedback to someone having delivered a poor presentation.

### A good feedback is delivered politely

There is no situation where it's OK to be rude.

Correcting someone in a polite manner is the only acceptable way to do.

And a polite feedback will always be easier to listen to than a rude one, which will be counterproductive.

Don't just rush to the person and deliver your feedback, but instead, inquire politely if the person is open to receiving feedbacks:

> Hello, I saw your presentation earlier. Would you be open to discuss it? I have constructive feedback to share with you, but now is maybe not the right time or place?

### A good feedback is delivered at the right time

A good feedback is delivered in a timely manner, close to the event/statement you'd like to comment. It's useless to express constructive criticism two years after somebody did something. That person is probably miles away of who it used to be.

You have as well to use your situational awareness to deliver a constructive feedback. Somebody exposing herself/himself on stage will have all the reason to feel offended if you expose a weak point of its presentation in front of everybody.

Don't be that "I have a question. It's more a comment actually." kind of person.

### A good feedback is based on facts

Assuming that someone did a talk with a slide deck that you did not liked, you can't just deliver a statement like:

> I did not like your slide deck. It's ugly.

This is a judgement, and not a proper feedback.

Instead, if you noticed that this slide deck was containing only text, your could go like follow:

> I noticed that your slides only contained unformatted text and no image at all.


### A good feedback provides guidance

Dropping your bomb and flying to other adventures is not the way to go. If you explain to somebody that what is say/do is not good, you should as well explain to them what they can do instead.

For example, if we take our previous example of somebody delivering a poor presentation, once you have communicated the factual shortcomings of it, you should explain why it's suboptimal, and how the person could do better:

> Since your presentation contains no picture, there is no chance that you can benefit from the Picture Superiority Effect, which is the phenomenon in which pictures are more remembered than words. You can read about this in Wikipedia. You could maybe substitute a few paragraphs by relevant pictures, for a start.

## Bonus: Feedback structure

If you are having a hard time structuring your feedback, you can use the [DESC method](https://your.yale.edu/sites/default/files/adviformanagers_usingdesctomakeyourdifficultconversations.pdf).

> DESCRIBE - Describe the behavior/situation as completely and objectively as possible. Just the
facts!
>
> "Jerry, the last project we worked on, I did all of the setup for the presentation by myself and it took me almost an hour.”
>
> EXPRESS - Express your feelings or thoughts about the behavior/situation. Try phrasing your
> statements using "I” and not "You”. Beginning sentences with You often puts people on the
> defensive, which means they won’t listen to you.
>
> "I felt overwhelmed, exhausted and frustrated.”
>
> SPECIFY - Specify what behavior/outcome you would prefer to happen.
>
> "I would like us to work together on the setup for the next presentation.”
>
> CONSEQUENCES - Specify the consequences if this happens. (Both positive and negative)
>
> "This way we can complete the setup in less time, giving us both a chance to
> gather our thoughts before we present.”

If we try to adapt that to our earlier example, it gives:

> Hey, I saw your presentation earlier. Is now a good time to share a constructive feedback?
>
> DESCRIBE: I couldn't avoid to notice that your presentation is containing only unformatted text and not picture.
>
> EXPRESS: It's packed with informations, but it does not benefit from the Picture Superiority effect, which is the phenomenon in which pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than words. And your audience is probably not remembering what you'd like them to take away.
>
> SPECIFY: You could try replacing some of your blocks of text by relevant picture any time possible.
>
> CONSEQUENCES: This way, your audience would probably remember more of the great things you shared.
