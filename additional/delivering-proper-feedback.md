# Delivering proper feedback

This document:
- defines clear boundaries of proper feedback, what is and what isn't,
- explains how to structure it with the DESC method.

## What feedback is not

Feedback is never taking its roots outside of facts:
* Giving statements based on interpersonal feelings is not proper feedback
* Expressing prejudice is not proper feedback
* Judging someone is not proper feedback

Feedback is never meant to harm somebody, but instead to help them grow:
* [Nagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagging) is not proper feedback
* [Bullying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying) is not proper feedback
* [Doxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing) is not proper feedback

Feedback is useless if incomplete:
* Don't assume the person receiving the feedback knows everything about the topic at hand. Provide all needed information or resources that support your feedback
* Don't provide criticism without guidance towards a better solution

Unsolicited feedback is not good feedback:
* Delivering unsolicited feedback is not educating, it's forcing your opinion on somebody who's not asking for it
* Doing it once is rude and mean
* Doing it repeatedly is just plain harassment

Delivering feedback is not a way to put you under the spotlights.

## What is proper feedback

TL;DR: **Polite, timely, factual and helpful**

All examples in this section will explore the fictional situation where you are providing feedback to someone who delivered a poor presentation.

### Good feedback is delivered politely

There is no situation where it's OK to be rude.

Rud feedback is counterproductive.

A polite feedback will always be easier to listen to than a rude one.

Correcting someone in a polite manner is the only acceptable way.

Don't just rush to the person to deliver your feedback, instead, inquire politely if the person is open to receiving feedback:

> Hello, I saw your presentation earlier. Would you be open to discuss it with me? I have constructive feedback/a few notes/a couple of observations to share with you, but now may not be the right time or place? Let me know, if you're open to this.

### Good feedback is delivered at the right time

Good feedback is delivered in a timely manner, close to the event/statement you'd like to comment on. Expressing constructive criticism two years after the fact is mostly useless. The person you're providing fedback to is probably miles away from who they used to be.

You must also use your situational awareness to deliver constructive feedback. Somebody exposing themselves on stage will have all the reasons to feel offended if you expose a weak point of their presentation in front of the whole audience.

Don't be that "I have a question. It's more of a comment, actually" type of person.

### Good feedback is based on facts

Assuming that someone delivered a talk with a slide deck that you did not like, you can't just deliver a statement like:

> I did not like your slide deck. It's ugly.

This is gratuitous judgement, not proper feedback at all.

Instead, if you noticed the deck only contained text, your feedback could be:

> I noticed that your slides only contained unformatted text and no image at all. Adding images can help your message stick longer. 


### Good feedback provides guidance

Dropping feedback as a bomb before flying towards other adventures is not the way to go. If you make the effort to lay out what could be improved, you might as well take time to point to an actual improvement.

For example, after pointing out the factual shortcomings of the presentation, you should explain why it's suboptimal, and how the person could do better:

> Since your presentation contains no picture, you will not benefit from the Picture Superiority Effect (the phenomenon in which pictures are more remembered than words). You can read about this [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_superiority_effect). How about replacing a few paragraphs with relevant pictures, for a start?

## Bonus: Feedback structure

If you are having a hard time structuring your feedback, you can use the [DESC method](https://your.yale.edu/sites/default/files/adviformanagers_usingdesctomakeyourdifficultconversations.pdf).

> DESCRIBE - Describe the behavior/situation as completely and objectively as possible. Just the
facts!
>
> "Jerry, for the last project we worked on, I managed all of the presentation setup by myself and it took me almost an hour.”
>
> EXPRESS - Express your feelings or thoughts about the behavior/situation. Try phrasing your
> statements using "I” and not "You”. Beginning sentences with You often puts people on the
> defensive, which means they won’t listen to you as openly as they could.
>
> "I felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and frustrated.”
>
> SPECIFY - Specify what behavior/outcome you would prefer to happen.
>
> "I would like us to work together on the setup for the next presentation.”
>
> CONSEQUENCES - Specify the consequences if this happens (both positive and negative).
>
> "This way we could complete the setup in less time, giving us both a chance to
> gather our thoughts before the presentation.”

If we try to adapt that to our earlier example, it goes like this:

> Hey, I saw your presentation earlier. Is now a good time to share some constructive feedback?
>
> DESCRIBE: I noticed that your presentation only contains unformatted text and no picture.
>
> EXPRESS: It's packed with information, but it does not benefit from the Picture Superiority effect, which is the phenomenon in which pictures and images are more likely to be remembered than words. And your audience is probably not remembering what you'd like them to take away.
>
> SPECIFY: You could try replacing some of your blocks of text by relevant picture any time possible.
>
> CONSEQUENCES: This way, your audience would probably remember more of the great things you shared.
